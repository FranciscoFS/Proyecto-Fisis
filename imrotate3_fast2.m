function B=imrotate3_fast(varargin)
%IMROTATE3_FAST - fast rotation of 3-D grayscale image
% 
%     B = IMROTATE3_FAST(V,ANGLES) rotates the 3-D grayscale image V (in order)
%     by ANGLES(1) around the x axis, ANGLES(2) around the y axis, and ANGLES(3) 
%     around the Z axis. 
%
%     B = IMROTATE3_FAST(V,{ANGLES AXES}) rotates V by ANGLES around the 
%     corresponding AXES (in order) 
% 
%     B = IMROTATE3_FAST(...,METHOD) uses the interpolation method specified by 
%     METHOD. METHOD is a string that can have one of the follwing values:
%           'linear' or 'bilinear' - bilinear interpolation (default).
%           'cubic' or 'bicubic' - bicubic interpolation.
%           'nearest' - nearest neighbor interpolation. 
% 
%     This function is designed to leverage the very fast imrotatemex called by 
%     IMROTATE to perform 3-D rotations. R2017A's IMROTATE3 uses IMWARP, which 
%     is often considerably slower than performing rotations separately. Moreover, 
%     testing reveals that IMWARP/IMROTATE3 show comparable performance when 
%     applied to large matrices of doubles/16bit integers, and are considerably 
%     slower when applied to 8-bit integers. Conversely, IMROTATE is considerably 
%     faster with 16 and 8-bit integers.
% 
%     IMROTATE3_FAST takes Euler-type angles (user provides rotations around 
%     specified axes and their order). Performing 3D rotations using axis-angle 
%     (as in matlab's IMROTATE3) can be accomplished by converting from Euler to
%     axis-angle. The functions eul2aa and aa2eul have been included to demonstrate 
%     this (only XYZ rotations have been included for this demo).
%
%     The features incorporated by BBOX and FILLVAL parameters in imrotate3 are not 
%     included here...but they are trivially easy to add. IMROTATE3_FAST sets these
%     to their defaults, FILLVAL=0, BBOX='loose'.
%
%     Note that the results are not identical to imrotate3...that's because while 
%     imrotate3 works in true 3-D, imrotate3_fast treats interpolation problems in
%     2-D. For the large datasets on which this was tested the differences seem 
%     trivial, although there is a translation that results from the iterative 
%     permutation method that must come from the repeated definition of centers, 
%     but I haven't been able to reason. The function IMROTATE3_FAST_TESTER shows 
%     a comparison between the two methods.
